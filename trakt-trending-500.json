There's Axl, her semi-nudist teenage son conceived while under the influence of Guns N' Roses; Sue, the awkward teenage daughter who fails at everything... but with the utmost of gusto; and their seven-year-old son Brick, whose best friend is his backpack.\nSometimes it seems like everyone is trying to get to the top, or struggling not to hit bottom, but we think Frankie and her family will find a lot of love, and a lot of laughs, somewhere in \"The Middle\".","first_aired":"2009-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Wednesday","time":"20:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":22,"certification":"TV-PG","network":"ABC (US)","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":null,"status":"returning series","rating":7.96664,"votes":1409,"updated_at":"2015-05-13T10:58:48.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","bg","fr","it","de","hu","pt"],"genres":["comedy"],"aired_episodes":144,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/413/fanarts/original/dd6aa90f04.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/413/fanarts/medium/dd6aa90f04.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/413/fanarts/thumb/dd6aa90f04.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/413/posters/original/b28b6b3455.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/413/posters/medium/b28b6b3455.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/413/posters/thumb/b28b6b3455.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/413/logos/original/225a613428.png"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/413/banners/original/5764cb0ca8.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/413/thumbs/original/3146623d65.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":3,"show":{"title":"Survivor","year":2000,"ids":{"trakt":14594,"slug":"survivor-2000","tvdb":76733,"imdb":"tt0239195","tmdb":14658,"tvrage":5418},"overview":"Sixteen or more castaways are split between two or more \"Tribes\", are taken to a remote isolated location and are forced to live off the land with meager supplies for roughly 39 days. Frequent physical challenges are used to pit the tribes against each other for Rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \"Immunity\", forcing the other tribe to attend \"Tribal Council\", where they must vote off one of their players. Once about half the players are remaining, the tribes are merged into a single tribe, and competitions are on an individual basis; winning Immunity prevents that player from being voted out, while several that are voted out at this stage form the game's \"Jury\". Once down to two or three people, a Final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury members. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \"Sole Survivor\" and win the $1 million prize. Survivor has introduced numerous modifications, or \"twists\", on the core rules in order to keep the players on their toes and to prevent players from relying on strategies that succeeded in prior seasons. These changes have included tribal switches, seasons starting with more than two tribes, the ability to exile a player from a tribe for a short time, Hidden Immunity Idols that players can use to save themselves at Tribal Council and a chance to return to regular gameplay after elimination through \"Redemption Island\".","first_aired":"2000-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Wednesday","time":"20:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":42,"certification":"TV-PG","network":"CBS","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":null,"status":"returning series","rating":7.44746,"votes":847,"updated_at":"2015-05-13T16:22:20.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en"],"genres":["reality"],"aired_episodes":454,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/014/594/fanarts/original/537ceb8a9f.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/014/594/fanarts/medium/537ceb8a9f.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/014/594/fanarts/thumb/537ceb8a9f.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/014/594/posters/original/31b07ebedf.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/014/594/posters/medium/31b07ebedf.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/014/594/posters/thumb/31b07ebedf.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/014/594/logos/original/a92e6b8467.png"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/014/594/thumbs/original/44bac7578e.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":3,"show":{"title":"The Last Man on Earth","year":2015,"ids":{"trakt":77779,"slug":"the-last-man-on-earth","tvdb":281622,"imdb":"tt3230454","tmdb":null,"tvrage":null},"overview":"The year is 2022, and after an unlikely event, only one man is left on earth: Phil Miller, who used to be just an average guy who loved his family and hated his job at the bank.

Recalling Lamb's command as a military police officer during World War II, the Mayor appeals to his sense of duty to look into a murder of a casino worker -- and so begins Lamb's clash with Vincent Savino, a ruthless Chicago gangster who plans to make Vegas his own. Assisting Lamb in keeping Law And Order are his two deputies: his diplomatic, even-keeled brother Jack  and his charming but impulsive son, Dixon.

In ``Naked and Afraid,'' two complete strangers -- a man and a woman -- meet in a very unique way: They're stranded in a dangerous, desolate location, without food and water, and they're completely naked. Each episode follows the two as they attempt to survive on their own for 21 days, with nothing but one personal item each and the knowledge that the only prize is their pride and sense of accomplishment. Because there is no other choice, the couple quickly get to know each other -- and their surroundings -- and hope that their instincts, survival skills and intestinal fortitude will serve them well.","first_aired":"2014-08-29T02:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Sunday","time":"22:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":42,"certification":null,"network":"Discovery","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":null,"status":"ended","rating":7.23288,"votes":146,"updated_at":"2015-05-12T10:37:54.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","nl","fr","zh"],"genres":[],"aired_episodes":30,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/058/445/fanarts/original/cfeccc090a.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/058/445/fanarts/medium/cfeccc090a.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/058/445/fanarts/thumb/cfeccc090a.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/058/445/posters/original/4d50dd3011.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/058/445/posters/medium/4d50dd3011.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/058/445/posters/thumb/4d50dd3011.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/058/445/logos/original/7d584e9b5a.png"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":null}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"Bakuman","year":2010,"ids":{"trakt":60951,"slug":"bakuman","tvdb":193811,"imdb":"tt1738419","tmdb":null,"tvrage":null},"overview":"The series follows talented artist Moritaka Mashiro and aspiring writer Akito Takagi, two ninth grade boys who wish to become mangaka.","first_aired":"2010-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Saturday","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"runtime":25,"certification":null,"network":"NHK","country":"jp","trailer":null,"homepage":null,"status":"ended","rating":8.23034,"votes":178,"updated_at":"2015-04-02T10:40:08.000Z","language":null,"available_translations":[],"genres":["animation","drama"],"aired_episodes":75,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/951/fanarts/original/992c56228b.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/951/fanarts/medium/992c56228b.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/951/fanarts/thumb/992c56228b.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/951/posters/original/df509b72b5.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/951/posters/medium/df509b72b5.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/951/posters/thumb/df509b72b5.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/951/logos/original/fd33276706.png"},"clearart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/951/cleararts/original/3966fc778e.png"},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":null}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"Happyish","year":2015,"ids":{"trakt":77743,"slug":"happyish","tvdb":277431,"imdb":"tt3095080","tmdb":null,"tvrage":null},"overview":"On his birthday, Thom Payne gets the gift of insignificance and also a new boss.

To combat it I've got special men - experts from the Army, the Police - from every service. These are The Professionals.\"  - George Cowley.  \nThe Professionals was one of British television's most popular and successful action series of the 1970s and 80s. At their peak in 1980 The Pros were earning as many as 17.6 million viewers. The Professionals began life in early 1977, provisionally titled The A-Squad, in an idea conceived by Brian Clemens, the then head of the independent TV company Avengers Mark I Productions. His aim was to create a rival for Thames television's hugely successful long-running police series The Sweeney.  Bodie, Doyle and Cowley could have looked very different to how we remember them as. A number of very different actors were considered for the three central roles, with neither of the final chosen team being the original choices. The final three were more or less drafted in when the first choice stars either declined or were axed. Gordon Jackson (formerly the distinctly unmenacing Butler Hudson in Upstairs Downstairs) and Martin Shaw (whose first TV appearance was as a hippie in 1960s Coronation Street) were first to be cast. During the filming of the first episode, Old Dog with New Tricks Bodie was in fact played by Anthony Andrews. Unfortunately, old mates Shaw and Andrews spent much of the time cracking up with laughter - hardly a recipe for ensuring the renowned edgy banter between the two leads. Lewis Collins (best known by this time as Gavin Rumsey in comedy series The Cuckoo Waltz) was brought in to play Bodie, with Andrews being given the heave-ho. Collins and Shaw had previously worked together just months earlier in an episode of The New Avengers, and were cast alongside each other again thanks to the 'sparky, abrasive' on-screen partnership that they generated. In other words, they didn't particularly like each other! But with the central cast complete, filming began on 20 June 1977, with the first episode Private Madness Public Danger debuting on Friday 30 December 1977. Criminal Intelligence 5 The basis of The Professionals was CI5 - Criminal Intelligence 5 - an organisation lead by surly Scotsman George Cowley (played by Gordon Jackson), a former MI5 head who founded the team as an 'umbrella organisation' to help alleviate London's ever-increasing level of criminal activity. CI5 consisted of up to forty men and women agents, but the main action was centred around Cowley's two top operatives; William Andrew Philip Bodie (Agent 3.7) and Raymond Doyle (4.5). Bodie (Lewis Collins) - he of the close-cropped hair, polo necks and smart suits - was a mercenary in Africa, who deserted the Merchant Navy to join the Paras and later the SAS, before being signed up to CI5 by Cowley. He was, on the surface, an uncompromising thug with a penchant for the 'hit first, ask questions later' theory - thinking nothing of causing 'damage' to a suspect if it meant getting the right results. Doyle (Martin Shaw) was a former Docklands Police Constable, and his more placid nature was reflected in his memorable bubble-perm hairstyle and casual clothing attire (i.e. old plaid jackets and skintight jeans). However, he possessed a tougher streak to match that of Bodie if ever riled by a particularly awkward suspect. Chalk and Cheese The show's major appeal lay in its well-balanced mix of strong acting and direction, coupled with Bodie and Doyle's sparky partnership and chalk-and-cheese personalities. Cowley's preoccupation with pure malt scotch and occasional bullet-wound limp were also a source of amusement for the Lads, but overall they each viewed one another with a great mutual respect. The fifty-seven episode run produced a great variety of gripping plots, most notably the destruction of a German terrorist group in Close Quarters, the testing of a potentially deadly laser gun in Hunter Hunted, a supposed crime-free town masking a squad of corrupt policeman in In the Public Interest and the trial of CI5 in The Rack to name but a few. Like any show, however, there were a number of dodgy episodes to contend with, the chief honour going to The Gun and Blood Sports during the generally below-par fourth season. Banned! The Professionals wasn't without controversy, though - and no, we don't mean Martin Shaw's hair (which was, amazingly, his own idea!). Klansmen, the thirteenth (unlucky for some?) and final episode was banned and remains unaired in the UK even to this day because it dealt with the subject of racism. Only now with the DVD release will British fans be able to see the episode for themselves. Eventually Lewis and Martin quit the series in 1981 when their four-year contracts expired and although Gordon was said to have been happy to continue, it was decided not to cast a set of new characters because of Lewis and Martin's popularity. However, both had become tired of the monotony of playing their characters - least of all Martin, who had begun to express his dislike of playing 'violent puppet' Doyle at approximately six weeks into the role! Filming was quickly wrapped up with Spy Probe in mid-1981, but due to several ITV strike disputes in the late 1970s, several episodes were held back and the fifth season did not begin transmission until November 1982. The final edition, No Stone was broadcast on Sunday 6 February 1983. Martin allegedly barred any further repeats being broadcast on British terrestrial TV until 1992 and now the only UK-based channel that regularly screens re-runs is satellite station Granada Plus, albeit with a ridiculous series of censorship rules in place (of course, to conceal unnecessary violence we assume, not to make way for more washing powder adverts). Then and Now The Professionals will forever be remembered for sparking such hard-hitting debate as: who was the best looking, Bodie or Doyle? (for the women), who had the smartest motor? (for the blokes) and who was going to be the first victim to be injured by Doyle's erupting perm? (for those mourning the demise of decent hairstyles as the Seventies kicked in). Since the series ended more than twenty years ago, the cast have had mixed fortunes in their careers. Gordon Jackson continued to work successfully in a number of high-profile film and TV roles until he very sadly passed away in 1990, at the age of 66. Martin Shaw appeared in The Chief and Rhodes in the mid-1990s, and has recently made a comeback to prime-time television, with starring roles in A&E and Judge John Deed. In 2003 he became the new face of P.D James' long-running detective, Adam Dalgliesh. Lewis Collins unfortunately fell victim to the dreaded typecasting, appearing in a series of ill-advised foreign action movies in the 1980s (although we rather liked Who Dares Wins!) His most recent UK TV appearances were in Cluedo - a thankfully now defunct quiz show presented by the likes of Richard Madeley - in 1991 and a cameo appearance in the dodgy ITV1 'comedy' series The Grimleys in 1999. He has spent the past few years concentrating on theatre work, including a role in the thriller Dangerous Corner, also in 1999. In 2002 Lewis guest-starred in an episode of police series The Bill. The New Professionals The series was revived in 1999, now under the very imaginative alias of The New Professionals. At first it was thought Lewis Collins would be making a comeback appearance, with Bodie being elevated to the position vacated by Cowley, but negotiations for this later fell through. Martin Shaw, on the other hand, was 'not invited' to reprise his role. Interest in the show was less than forthcoming; the first series being pushed into a rather unsociable time slot on the satellite channel Sky One. It now seems unlikely that another season will be made. Over the past decade there has been a renewed interest for The Professionals and all things retro. The memorable 1996 Nissan Car advertisement (\"This car's well-sprung\" / \"A bit like your hair!\") and the release of all 57 episodes on DVD in 2002, will ensure that the show is likely to gain a whole new generation of fans following its Silver Jubilee year.","first_aired":"1977-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":"Europe/London"},"runtime":50,"certification":"TV-14","network":"ITV1","country":"gb","trailer":"http://youtube.com/watch?v=voNprtvhQMY","homepage":null,"status":"ended","rating":8.83333,"votes":12,"updated_at":"2015-02-10T04:03:35.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","cs"],"genres":["drama"],"aired_episodes":114,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/011/122/fanarts/original/789e9c6f4a.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/011/122/fanarts/medium/789e9c6f4a.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/011/122/fanarts/thumb/789e9c6f4a.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/011/122/posters/original/dad1825022.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/011/122/posters/medium/dad1825022.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/011/122/posters/thumb/dad1825022.jpg"},"logo":{"full":null},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/011/122/thumbs/original/9c99cfa040.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"Reign","year":2013,"ids":{"trakt":48561,"slug":"reign","tvdb":269602,"imdb":"tt2710394","tmdb":48865,"tvrage":34590},"overview":"Chronicles the rise to power of Mary Queen of Scots when she arrives in France as a 15-year-old, betrothed to Prince Francis, and with her three best friends as ladies-in-waiting.

When patriarch Wolfgang West is sentenced to four years in jail, his wife Cheryl decides enough is enough; the family are cleaning up their act and going straight. Can the Wests live up to Cheryl's resolve and stay out of crime? It's not easy to be a saint when you have the DNA of a sinner.\n\nOutrageous Fortune follows one cheerfully trashy crime family's attempts to stay out of trouble: matriarch Cheryl, determined to save her brood from following in their father's footsteps, eldest son Jethro, an ambitious lawyer-to-be with a few secrets, Jethro's twin Van (identical except in the brains department) who only wants to be like his dad, 18-year-old Pascalle, who wants to be Rachel Hunter, 15-year-old movie buff Loretta, who is blackmailing her teacher, and Grandpa Ted, who may have Alzheimer's - unless he's just playing it up to annoy people.\n\nThen there's Detective Sergeant Wayne Judd, the West family nemesis; the Hongs, a wealthy Asian family who may or may not have Triad connections, Caroline Darling, Loretta's deputy principal, who has been having an affair with Jethro since he was a 15-year-old student, Munter, Van's best mate and partner in crime, and Wolf himself, who does not intend to take his wife's sudden wave of righteousness lying down.\n\nOutrageous Fortune is a family comedy-drama about the wrong sort of people trying to do the right thing when the rewards for going straight are neither immediate nor bountiful. Outrageous Fortune is a bold, fresh comedy-drama which is by turns bawdy, action-packed, satirical and trashy - but only ever a heartbeat away from reality.

No, not like that (there are some lines even they won’t cross), we’re talking the non-romantic, go-to-the-doctor’s-office type of baby-making.

That’s where Luke meets Prudence (Kelly Brook, “Smallville”), a free-spirited British girl who’s slated to go back to England in a matter of days. Lizzy isn’t a huge fan — it might have something to do with Prudence waltzing around their apartment naked — but Luke really hits it off with her. Soon they’re spending every last minute of her limited time together. Then, just as Lizzy discovers that she’s actually pregnant, Luke announces that he and Prudence got married and a different kind of family is born.","first_aired":"2015-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Tuesday","time":"21:30","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":20,"certification":null,"network":"NBC","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":null,"status":"ended","rating":6.23333,"votes":60,"updated_at":"2015-05-09T10:50:52.000Z","language":null,"available_translations":[],"genres":["comedy"],"aired_episodes":6,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/077/963/fanarts/original/c74ed3d04d.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/077/963/fanarts/medium/c74ed3d04d.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/077/963/fanarts/thumb/c74ed3d04d.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/077/963/posters/original/6c65bfbc60.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/077/963/posters/medium/6c65bfbc60.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/077/963/posters/thumb/6c65bfbc60.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/077/963/logos/original/26c7327ef6.png"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/077/963/banners/original/42f5daab6b.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/077/963/thumbs/original/147f2ba285.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles","year":2012,"ids":{"trakt":51490,"slug":"teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-2012","tvdb":261451,"imdb":"tt1877889","tmdb":51817,"tvrage":27772},"overview":"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back in an all-new animated series on Nickelodeon!

It first aired May 20, 2012. The series is produced by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim's production company Absolutely Productions.\n\nThe show is a parody of low-budget public access talk shows, hosted by Eric Andre and Hannibal Buress. André is a hyperactive and dysfunctional host who often stutters or otherwise fails to properly maintain his screen presence. He often overreacts during interviews, acts aggressively towards his crew members, diverts from the script and refuses to read the cue cards. The surreal attitude of the show is emphasized by \"celebrity\" guests that have nothing in common with the actual stars they purport to be except their announced names, although occasionally genuine celebrities do appear.\n\nBesides the studio segments that are the main focus of the show, short sketches, candid camera footage and non sequiturs, usually focused on André's absurd behavior, are featured in the program.","first_aired":"2012-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Friday","time":"00:15","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":15,"certification":null,"network":"Adult Swim","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":null,"status":"returning series","rating":7.93333,"votes":45,"updated_at":"2015-04-23T10:44:37.000Z","language":null,"available_translations":[],"genres":["comedy","talk-show"],"aired_episodes":30,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/066/602/fanarts/original/6b59482c50.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/066/602/fanarts/medium/6b59482c50.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/066/602/fanarts/thumb/6b59482c50.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/066/602/posters/original/646ae82557.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/066/602/posters/medium/646ae82557.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/066/602/posters/thumb/646ae82557.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/066/602/logos/original/d2b0282d9c.png"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":null}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"Peppa Pig","year":2004,"ids":{"trakt":12172,"slug":"peppa-pig","tvdb":79222,"imdb":"tt0426769","tmdb":12225,"tvrage":7162},"overview":"Peppa Pig is a loveable, cheeky little piggy who lives with her little brother George, Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig.
