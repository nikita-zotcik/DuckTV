An intimate drama of love and betrayal, masters and slaves, and husbands and wives, it chronicles epic times that saw the fall of a republic and the creation of an empire. The series begins in 52 BC, as Gaius Julius Caesar has completed his masterful conquest of Gaul after eight years of war, and is preparing to return to Rome. He heads home with thousands of loyal battle-hardened men, huge amounts of loot in gold and slaves, and a populist agenda for radical social change. Terrified, the aristocracy threatens to prosecute Caesar for war crimes as soon as he sets foot in Rome. Caesar's old friend and mentor, Pompey Magnus, attempts to foment mutiny in order to maintain the balance of power. Two of Caesar's soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, thwart Pompey's plan and in the process, win the eternal gratitude of Caesar and the Julian clan, affording the two plebian officers an intimate view of the ruling class. The fates of Pullo and Vorenus become entwined with those of Caesar, Mark Antony, Cleopatra and the boy Octavian, a strange and awkward child who, by political guile and bloody force, will become the first emperor of Rome.","first_aired":"2005-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Sunday","time":"21:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":60,"certification":"TV-MA","network":"HBO","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007r6t5","status":"ended","rating":8.78104,"votes":3681,"updated_at":"2016-06-02T10:31:48.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["de","en","fr","es","hu","zh","ro","he","it","bs","pt","ru","cs","pl","el","nl"],"genres":["drama","history","action","adventure"],"aired_episodes":22,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/fanarts/original/5908d3d8f9.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/fanarts/medium/5908d3d8f9.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/fanarts/thumb/5908d3d8f9.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/posters/original/c25412aba3.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/posters/medium/c25412aba3.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/posters/thumb/c25412aba3.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/logos/original/86c99d80ed.png"},"clearart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/cleararts/original/910971f9c7.png"},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/banners/original/4a9b4d17d6.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/thumbs/original/bce86a9234.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":2,"show":{"title":"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air","year":1990,"ids":{"trakt":1879,"slug":"the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air","tvdb":76738,"imdb":"tt0098800","tmdb":1892,"tvrage":null},"overview":"A wealthy family living in Bel-Air, California, receives a dubious gift from their poorer relations in Philadelphia when  Will Smith arrives as The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.

The 12-episode half-hour series premieres on A&E, Wednesday, December 1 at 10PM ET/PT. Each episode of \"Storage Wars\" follows a group of bidders as they get a quick peek inside the units, aided only by the beam of a flashlight. They then must assess on the spot if the unit is worth a bid and how high they will actually go to grasp the gold. The high-stakes fun begins as we see if the resulting buy is full of mostly trash... or true treasure. Driven by Dan Dotson, one of the most successful and outrageous auctioneers in the country, the cast of buyers is as colorful and varied as the treasures they uncover.","first_aired":"2010-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Tuesday","time":"22:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":30,"certification":"TV-PG","network":"A&E","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars/","status":"returning series","rating":7.06744,"votes":430,"updated_at":"2016-06-06T12:51:10.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","fr","da","ru"],"genres":["reality","documentary"],"aired_episodes":208,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/034/822/fanarts/original/a9067a7d47.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/034/822/fanarts/medium/a9067a7d47.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/034/822/fanarts/thumb/a9067a7d47.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/034/822/posters/original/f046649e2b.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/034/822/posters/medium/f046649e2b.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/034/822/posters/thumb/f046649e2b.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/034/822/logos/original/6c4ceb924b.png"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/034/822/thumbs/original/5950eee06f.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":2,"show":{"title":"Property Brothers","year":2011,"ids":{"trakt":34908,"slug":"property-brothers","tvdb":254292,"imdb":"tt1827882","tmdb":35058,"tvrage":null},"overview":"Twin brothers Jonathan and Drew Scott aim to help couples find fixer-uppers and transform them into dream homes.

They are all top agents of the DEA, FBI, and Customs and they are living in this house unofficially known as \"Graceland\". \"Graceland\" is a place full of secrets, and bad, good, and blurred moments too.

As the boys began to dig, they found a number of intriguing artifacts. It was the end of the piracy era and rumors of buried treasure were rampant. The boys’ discovery launched a treasure hunt that has spanned more than 200 years, cost millions of dollars and involved dozens of speculators, engineers and even famous personalities such as John Wayne, Errol Flynn and Franklin D. Roosevelt.The search had gone dormant, but now, Rick and Marty Lagina, two brothers from Michigan, have bought most of the island and have renewed the efforts to discover the legendary treasure. Since childhood, Oak Island has been a magical place of intrigue for these men. With Marty’s financial backing, Rick is now leading the adventure of his life. But will their luck be any different from the many explorers who sought treasure before them and failed?The Laginas insist that their goal is the fun of a treasure-hunting adventure, and if it becomes something that could splinter their brotherly bond, they’ll walk away.  But obsession has been known to grip treasure seekers on Oak Island.Many men have taken on the hunt with the best of intentions, only to be left with decimated fortunes, broken spirits and lost lives. An ominous legend says that seven people must die in pursuit of the treasure before Oak Island will reveal her secrets. So far, the body count stands at six.","first_aired":"2014-01-06T02:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Tuesday","time":"21:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":60,"certification":"TV-PG","network":"History","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://history.com/shows/the-curse-of-oak-island","status":"returning series","rating":7.51282,"votes":117,"updated_at":"2016-03-26T00:36:27.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["de","en","pt","hu","es","ro","ru","cs"],"genres":["documentary","mystery"],"aired_episodes":28,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/184/fanarts/original/71b9800c51.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/184/fanarts/medium/71b9800c51.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/184/fanarts/thumb/71b9800c51.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/184/posters/original/4747d215e1.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/184/posters/medium/4747d215e1.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/184/posters/thumb/4747d215e1.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/184/logos/original/7e5b565d3b.png"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/184/banners/original/2e4222cc72.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":null}}}},{"watchers":2,"show":{"title":"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver","year":2014,"ids":{"trakt":60267,"slug":"last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver","tvdb":278518,"imdb":"tt3530232","tmdb":60694,"tvrage":40882},"overview":"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver is an American late-night talk and news satire television program.

By infecting humans with its bite, the monster can create aggressive and undead creatures known as Kabane. On the island Hinomoto, located in the far east, people have built stations to shelter themselves from these creatures. People access the station, as well as transport wares between them, with the help of a locomotive running on steam, called Hayajiro. Ikoma, a boy who lives in the Aragane station and helps to build Hayajiro, creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu in order to defeat the creatures. One day, as he waits for an opportunity to use his weapon, he meets a girl named Mumei, who is excused from the mandatory Kabane inspection. During the night, Ikuma meets Mumei again as he sees Hayajiro going out of control. The staff on the locomotive has turned into the creatures. The station, now under attack by Kabane, is the opportunity Ikoma has been looking for.

Really, it's true. Yet, the public largely associates these dogs with fear, danger and unyielding aggression toward people. Pit bulls actually were once ranked among American's top five favorite pets and also known as the \"nanny dog\" for their gentleness with children. But they have fallen from grace. Now often associated with gang members, dog fighting and attacks, pit bulls are misunderstood, misjudged and under-appreciated. Their bad rap stems from many misconceptions - the biggest is that they are \"killer\" dogs that pose a threat to society. While most dogs are known as man's best friend, people have lost hope for the pit bull. That's about to change. Animal Planet introduces you to this dog's greatest ally, and she's not a man - she's a fiery red-headed leading lady, and she's determined to end the needless hostility toward pit bulls. Meet Tia Maria Torres - 49-year-old mother, top pit bull trainer and founder and owner of Villalobos Rescue Center - the country's largest rescue facility for pit bulls. In PIT BULLS AND PAROLEES, which premieres Friday, October 30, at 10 PM et/pt, Torres is dead set on fighting the perception that pit bulls are the pariahs of the dog world and giving the ones in her care the love they deserve.","first_aired":"2009-10-31T02:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Saturday","time":"22:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":60,"certification":null,"network":"Animal Planet","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/pitbulls-and-parolees/","status":"returning series","rating":9.06667,"votes":15,"updated_at":"2016-03-01T10:34:25.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en"],"genres":["documentary"],"aired_episodes":103,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/031/400/fanarts/original/86208eb62f.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/031/400/fanarts/medium/86208eb62f.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/031/400/fanarts/thumb/86208eb62f.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/031/400/posters/original/86d9a5a104.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/031/400/posters/medium/86d9a5a104.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/031/400/posters/thumb/86d9a5a104.jpg"},"logo":{"full":null},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/031/400/banners/original/c901b79663.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":null}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"Gun X Sword","year":2005,"ids":{"trakt":31568,"slug":"gun-x-sword","tvdb":79135,"imdb":"tt0991047","tmdb":31706,"tvrage":null},"overview":"The story is set on the \"Planet of Endless Illusion\", a place where rogues of all sorts gather.

All of them seek care at Columbia and Weill Cornell Hospitals, the crown jewels of the prestigious New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.

The eight-part series takes a candid look at how cutting edge medicine often makes the difference, although even the best surgeons can find themselves flirting with disaster. The raucous ER staff trade jibes with strong-willed New Yorkers in moments that can be poignantly heartbreaking or off-the-hook hilarious. These doctors spend far more time with each other than with their families, developing complicated and intertwined personal relationships. \"NY Med\" premieres TUESDAY, JULY 10 (10:00-11:00 p.m., ET) on the ABC Television Network.","first_aired":"2012-07-11T02:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Thursday","time":"22:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":60,"certification":null,"network":"ABC (US)","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://abc.go.com/shows/ny-med","status":"returning series","rating":8.71429,"votes":14,"updated_at":"2016-05-26T10:37:51.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en"],"genres":["documentary"],"aired_episodes":16,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/620/fanarts/original/b5b94defa1.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/620/fanarts/medium/b5b94defa1.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/620/fanarts/thumb/b5b94defa1.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/620/posters/original/2cd17fa483.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/620/posters/medium/2cd17fa483.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/620/posters/thumb/2cd17fa483.jpg"},"logo":{"full":null},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":null}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"The Fall","year":2013,"ids":{"trakt":48703,"slug":"the-fall","tvdb":258107,"imdb":"tt2294189","tmdb":49010,"tvrage":35498},"overview":"Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson is brought in from the London Metropolitan Police to help catch the killer when a murder in Belfast remains unsolved.As Gibson travels across from London, we are introduced to the murderer himself; Paul Spector.","first_aired":"2013-05-13T20:30:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Sunday","time":"21:30","timezone":"Europe/London"},"runtime":60,"certification":"TV-MA","network":"RTÉ One","country":"gb","trailer":"http://youtube.com/watch?v=yXuJONpEpXg","homepage":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0295tcf","status":"returning series","rating":8.17141,"votes":1686,"updated_at":"2016-05-31T10:31:21.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","el","it","de","es","fr","hu","ru","he","bs","pl","hr","da","nl"],"genres":["drama","thriller"],"aired_episodes":17,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/fanarts/original/1059b816cc.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/fanarts/medium/1059b816cc.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/fanarts/thumb/1059b816cc.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/posters/original/0ae052b331.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/posters/medium/0ae052b331.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/posters/thumb/0ae052b331.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/logos/original/6ce0b543a4.png"},"clearart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/cleararts/original/913b009ec7.png"},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/banners/original/9144c33f78.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/048/703/thumbs/original/69c43ed191.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"Houdini","year":2014,"ids":{"trakt":48847,"slug":"houdini","tvdb":284760,"imdb":"tt3132738","tmdb":49157,"tvrage":37306},"overview":"Follow the man behind the magic as he finds fame, engages in espionage, battles spiritualists and encounters the greatest names of the era, from U.S. presidents to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Grigori Rasputin.
