Thirtysomething Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) has made her share of mistakes in life, but she has been doing her best to see that her college-bound daughter - and best friend in the world - Rory (Alexis Bledel), doesn't follow in her footsteps. That may be easier said than done, considering that the two share the same interests, the same intellect, the same coffee addiction and the same eyes. Rory is more serious than Lorelai, but there are tendencies, especially in the love department, that clearly indicate she is her mother's daughter. From the beginning, this unique mother-daughter team has been growing up together. Lorelai was just Rory's age when she became pregnant and made the tough decision to raise her baby alone.Gilmore Girls was the first series to make it to air supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund. An initiative between some of the nation's top advertisers and The WB, the program is intended to offer a greater array of compelling family programming on network television. The strong and loving mother-daughter relationship portrayed in Gilmore Girls reflects the growing reality of this new type of American family.","first_aired":"2000-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Tuesday","time":"20:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":45,"certification":"TV-14","network":"The CW","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://www2.warnerbros.com/gilmoregirls/","status":"ended","rating":8.48863,"votes":2771,"updated_at":"2016-06-07T10:33:19.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","sk","de","es","cs","hu","ro","it","bs","ru","fr"],"genres":["comedy","drama"],"aired_episodes":153,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/004/562/fanarts/original/d7fd737953.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/004/562/fanarts/medium/d7fd737953.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/004/562/fanarts/thumb/d7fd737953.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/004/562/posters/original/8082317c4b.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/004/562/posters/medium/8082317c4b.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/004/562/posters/thumb/8082317c4b.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/004/562/logos/original/67a8869883.png"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/004/562/banners/original/e191a6187f.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/004/562/thumbs/original/099977591e.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":8,"show":{"title":"The Vampire Diaries","year":2009,"ids":{"trakt":18083,"slug":"the-vampire-diaries","tvdb":95491,"imdb":"tt1405406","tmdb":18165,"tvrage":21766},"overview":"As the school year begins, Elena Gilbert is immediately drawn to a handsome and mysterious new student, Stefan Salvatore.

However, while this socially awkward group is comfortable with each other's humor and quirks, life outside their circle confounds them, so they rely on Paige Dineen, who has a young, gifted son, to translate the world for them, while also helping each other learn how to fit in.","first_aired":"2014-09-22T07:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Monday","time":"22:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":45,"certification":"TV-14","network":"CBS","country":"us","trailer":"http://youtube.com/watch?v=j9-6DRiLsYE","homepage":"http://www.cbs.com/shows/scorpion/","status":"returning series","rating":7.33871,"votes":2232,"updated_at":"2016-06-10T10:55:12.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["fr","en","zh","el","de","pl","es","hu","pt","cs","bs","it","ru","da","tr","he"],"genres":["drama","action","crime"],"aired_episodes":46,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/fanarts/original/cb36116214.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/fanarts/medium/cb36116214.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/fanarts/thumb/cb36116214.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/posters/original/c727fa44a1.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/posters/medium/c727fa44a1.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/posters/thumb/c727fa44a1.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/logos/original/d91e86590b.png"},"clearart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/cleararts/original/133de20ea5.png"},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/banners/original/82c2115e62.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/060/356/thumbs/original/dd505e4838.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":6,"show":{"title":"The Night Shift","year":2014,"ids":{"trakt":60362,"slug":"the-night-shift","tvdb":269640,"imdb":"tt2477230","tmdb":60804,"tvrage":35812},"overview":"\"The Night Shift\" focuses on the men and women who work the overnight shift at San Antonio Memorial Hospital.

The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother.","first_aired":"2007-08-17T07:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Monday","time":"10:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":11,"certification":"TV-Y","network":"Disney Channel (US)","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://disneychannel.disney.com/phineas-and-ferb","status":"ended","rating":8.3272,"votes":489,"updated_at":"2016-05-08T10:59:08.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","bg","de","es","sv","pt","hu","ru","he","ro"],"genres":["animation","comedy","fantasy","science-fiction","family","music","children"],"aired_episodes":224,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/fanarts/original/afae8b3e68.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/fanarts/medium/afae8b3e68.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/fanarts/thumb/afae8b3e68.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/posters/original/dec187d09b.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/posters/medium/dec187d09b.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/posters/thumb/dec187d09b.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/logos/original/18f28a4e97.png"},"clearart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/cleararts/original/c059f8e666.png"},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/banners/original/769e13720d.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/865/thumbs/original/e7da7d3845.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":2,"show":{"title":"Rome","year":2005,"ids":{"trakt":1878,"slug":"rome","tvdb":73508,"imdb":"tt0384766","tmdb":1891,"tvrage":5047},"overview":"\"Rome\" is the saga of two ordinary Roman soldiers and their families. An intimate drama of love and betrayal, masters and slaves, and husbands and wives, it chronicles epic times that saw the fall of a republic and the creation of an empire. The series begins in 52 BC, as Gaius Julius Caesar has completed his masterful conquest of Gaul after eight years of war, and is preparing to return to Rome. He heads home with thousands of loyal battle-hardened men, huge amounts of loot in gold and slaves, and a populist agenda for radical social change. Terrified, the aristocracy threatens to prosecute Caesar for war crimes as soon as he sets foot in Rome. Caesar's old friend and mentor, Pompey Magnus, attempts to foment mutiny in order to maintain the balance of power. Two of Caesar's soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, thwart Pompey's plan and in the process, win the eternal gratitude of Caesar and the Julian clan, affording the two plebian officers an intimate view of the ruling class. The fates of Pullo and Vorenus become entwined with those of Caesar, Mark Antony, Cleopatra and the boy Octavian, a strange and awkward child who, by political guile and bloody force, will become the first emperor of Rome.","first_aired":"2005-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Sunday","time":"21:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":60,"certification":"TV-MA","network":"HBO","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007r6t5","status":"ended","rating":8.78104,"votes":3681,"updated_at":"2016-06-02T10:31:48.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["de","en","fr","es","hu","zh","ro","he","it","bs","pt","ru","cs","pl","el","nl"],"genres":["drama","history","action","adventure"],"aired_episodes":22,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/fanarts/original/5908d3d8f9.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/fanarts/medium/5908d3d8f9.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/fanarts/thumb/5908d3d8f9.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/posters/original/c25412aba3.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/posters/medium/c25412aba3.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/posters/thumb/c25412aba3.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/logos/original/86c99d80ed.png"},"clearart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/cleararts/original/910971f9c7.png"},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/banners/original/4a9b4d17d6.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/878/thumbs/original/bce86a9234.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":2,"show":{"title":"Horizon","year":1964,"ids":{"trakt":1953,"slug":"horizon","tvdb":74379,"imdb":"tt0318224","tmdb":1966,"tvrage":7864},"overview":"Horizon is BBC Two's flagship 50-minute science documentary series.

Raised by hippie parents, she was taught to shun convention, trust her wildest instincts, and find the joy in everyday life. Her husband, Greg Montgomery (Thomas Gibson, \"Chicago Hope\"), is a conservative, Harvard-educated attorney and the yin to Dharma's yang. Married on their first date, they have remained committed to each other from day one, despite the obstacles presented by the world around them.Among those obstacles are Dharma's counterculture parents, Abby (Mimi Kennedy) and Larry (Alan Rachins), who recently brought another bohemian bundle of joy — baby Harry — into the world. On the other side, literally, are Greg's uptight, blue-blood parents, Kitty (Susan Sullivan) and Edward (Mitchell Ryan), who've slowly but surely come to accept the fact that their son married outside the country club boundaries.

By infecting humans with its bite, the monster can create aggressive and undead creatures known as Kabane. On the island Hinomoto, located in the far east, people have built stations to shelter themselves from these creatures. People access the station, as well as transport wares between them, with the help of a locomotive running on steam, called Hayajiro. Ikoma, a boy who lives in the Aragane station and helps to build Hayajiro, creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu in order to defeat the creatures. One day, as he waits for an opportunity to use his weapon, he meets a girl named Mumei, who is excused from the mandatory Kabane inspection. During the night, Ikuma meets Mumei again as he sees Hayajiro going out of control. The staff on the locomotive has turned into the creatures. The station, now under attack by Kabane, is the opportunity Ikoma has been looking for.

A natural expansion for The Real Housewives franchise, the extravagant, over-the-top city of Dallas is deeply rooted in Texan pride, where people believe that if they are lucky enough to live in the Lone Star State, they are lucky enough. The series delves into the lives of five sophisticated southern socialites – Cary Deuber, Tiffany Hendra, Stephanie Hollman, LeeAnne Locken and Brandi Redmond, along with their friend Marie Reyes – as they climb their way to the top of the city's most exclusive circle.

The result is a unique and unrepeatable event, since many of the eyewitnesses captured on film did not have long left to live. Each hour-long programme is carefully structured to focus on a key theme or campaign, from the rise of Nazi Germany to Hitler's downfall and the onset of the Cold War. There are no academic \"talking heads\" here to spell out an official version of history; the narration, delivered with wonderful gravitas by Sir Laurence Olivier, is kept to a minimum. The show's great coup was to allow the participants to speak for themselves. Painstaking research in the archives of the Imperial War Museum also unearthed a vast quantity of newsreel footage, including on occasion the cameraman's original raw rushes which present an unvarnished and never-before-seen picture of important events. Carl Davis' impressive score underlines the grand scale of the enterprise.","first_aired":"1973-10-31T21:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Wednesday","time":"21:00","timezone":"Europe/London"},"runtime":60,"certification":"TV-MA","network":"ITV","country":"gb","trailer":null,"homepage":null,"status":"ended","rating":9.43956,"votes":91,"updated_at":"2016-03-17T10:40:47.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","es","cs","ru","el","zh"],"genres":["documentary"],"aired_episodes":26,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/749/fanarts/original/d66867b617.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/749/fanarts/medium/d66867b617.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/749/fanarts/thumb/d66867b617.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/749/posters/original/ba60b6c416.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/749/posters/medium/ba60b6c416.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/749/posters/thumb/ba60b6c416.jpg"},"logo":{"full":null},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/749/thumbs/original/a52963d6a0.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"Midsomer Murders","year":1997,"ids":{"trakt":762,"slug":"midsomer-murders","tvdb":76846,"imdb":"tt0118401","tmdb":764,"tvrage":4466},"overview":"A veteran DCI and his young Sergeant investigate murders around the regional community of Midsomer.","first_aired":"1997-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Sunday","time":"21:00","timezone":"Europe/London"},"runtime":120,"certification":null,"network":"ITV1","country":"gb","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://www.itv.com/midsomermurders/","status":"returning series","rating":8.09886,"votes":263,"updated_at":"2016-06-08T10:53:45.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","sv","de","da","hu","ro","bs","ru","bg","fr","es","cs"],"genres":["drama","mystery","crime","action"],"aired_episodes":110,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/762/fanarts/original/23e0f2ae3c.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/762/fanarts/medium/23e0f2ae3c.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/762/fanarts/thumb/23e0f2ae3c.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/762/posters/original/44ab4d197a.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/762/posters/medium/44ab4d197a.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/762/posters/thumb/44ab4d197a.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/762/logos/original/2a9a5cab7e.PNG"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/000/762/thumbs/original/079a8d75c2.png"}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"Peep Show","year":2003,"ids":{"trakt":812,"slug":"peep-show","tvdb":71656,"imdb":"tt0387764","tmdb":815,"tvrage":null},"overview":"Essentially, a take on the 'odd-couple' sitcom, Peep Show revolves around the lives of two twentysomethings, Mark and Jeremy, who share a flat.Mark is an office worker, with a bleak outlook on life. who obsesses over his co-worker, Sophie.

After escaping from their custody, Jarod begins traveling the country, searching for clues to his true identity while posing as a doctor, police officer, attorney, or some other character who helps those in trouble. The Centre's directors are determined to return Jarod to The Centre to further their mysterious plan. A team of operatives, led by Miss Parker, attempts to find and capture The Pretender. Jarod's extreme intelligence combined with his childlike innocence create a memorable and endearing character that was popular with viewers.","first_aired":"1996-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":43,"certification":null,"network":"NBC","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":null,"status":"ended","rating":8.18889,"votes":450,"updated_at":"2016-02-07T10:31:43.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","fr","bs"],"genres":["drama","mystery","science-fiction"],"aired_episodes":86,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/694/fanarts/original/129aa854e2.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/694/fanarts/medium/129aa854e2.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/694/fanarts/thumb/129aa854e2.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/694/posters/original/fb5c4546df.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/694/posters/medium/fb5c4546df.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/694/posters/thumb/fb5c4546df.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/694/logos/original/79b9fcbd3d.png"},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/694/banners/original/93698e1fd3.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/694/thumbs/original/f2f82b472f.jpg"}}}},{"watchers":1,"show":{"title":"How It's Made","year":2001,"ids":{"trakt":1737,"slug":"how-it-s-made","tvdb":79485,"imdb":"tt0835010","tmdb":1749,"tvrage":13490},"overview":"Have you ever wondered how the products you use every day are made?

When patriarch Wolfgang West is sentenced to four years in jail, his wife Cheryl decides enough is enough; the family are cleaning up their act and going straight. Can the Wests live up to Cheryl's resolve and stay out of crime? It's not easy to be a saint when you have the DNA of a sinner.Outrageous Fortune follows one cheerfully trashy crime family's attempts to stay out of trouble: matriarch Cheryl, determined to save her brood from following in their father's footsteps, eldest son Jethro, an ambitious lawyer-to-be with a few secrets, Jethro's twin Van (identical except in the brains department) who only wants to be like his dad, 18-year-old Pascalle, who wants to be Rachel Hunter, 15-year-old movie buff Loretta, who is blackmailing her teacher, and Grandpa Ted, who may have Alzheimer's - unless he's just playing it up to annoy people.Then there's Detective Sergeant Wayne Judd, the West family nemesis; the Hongs, a wealthy Asian family who may or may not have Triad connections, Caroline Darling, Loretta's deputy principal, who has been having an affair with Jethro since he was a 15-year-old student, Munter, Van's best mate and partner in crime, and Wolf himself, who does not intend to take his wife's sudden wave of righteousness lying down.Outrageous Fortune is a family comedy-drama about the wrong sort of people trying to do the right thing when the rewards for going straight are neither immediate nor bountiful. Outrageous Fortune is a bold, fresh comedy-drama which is by turns bawdy, action-packed, satirical and trashy - but only ever a heartbeat away from reality.
